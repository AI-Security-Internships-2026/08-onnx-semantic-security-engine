### Personal Introduction
My name is Muhammad Sikandar Hussain. I am studying BS Artificial Intelligence at National University of Science and Technology. I am interested in this project because it sits at the intersection of machine learning and cybersecurity.

### What I Did This Week
- Completed full orientation: read `README.md` and `docs/proposal.md`
- Set up the development environment successfully
- Ran the starter script `src/main.py` without errors
- Created my working branch following the repo branching conventions
- Researched the problem domain: ONNX, semantic security, edge inference
- Identified 5 foundational references for the literature review

### What I Learned
- What ONNX is and why it enables model portability across frameworks and hardware targets
- What a semantic security engine does differently from signature-based intrusion detection systems
- Why edge inference constraints (memory, latency, compute) shape every design decision in this project
- The landscape of existing IDS datasets and related prior work

### Challenges / Questions for Supervisor
- What type of threat data will we primarily work with — network traffic features, raw logs, or both?
- What is the primary target edge device (Raspberry Pi 4, Jetson Nano, or other)?
- Is the classifier expected to use classical ML (Random Forest, XGBoost) or a neural network approach?

### Next Week Plan
- Read the 5 identified references in depth
- Write full literature review with summaries and gap analysis
- Research additional datasets
- Begin exploring the `datasets/` folder in the repository
- Research ONNX export pipeline from PyTorch in detail

## Week 2

**Branch:** `sikandarhussain-week-02`
**PR link:** _[Add link after opening PR]_

### Checklist
- [x] Downloaded CSE-CIC-IDS2018 Kaggle mirror (CSV only — ~1.5 GB, not raw PCAP)
- [x] Ran basic pandas exploration: class distribution, missing values, feature ranges
- [x] Trained a baseline MLP classifier in PyTorch and exported to ONNX
- [x] Validated ONNX output matches PyTorch on 10 test samples
- [x] Drafted `docs/proposal.md` sections 3 and 4

### What I Did This Week
- Downloaded and explored the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset (shape: 1048575 rows, 80 columns) to understand the available features and class imbalances (Benign: 63.67%, FTP-BruteForce: 18.44%, SSH-Bruteforce: 17.89%).
- Developed and ran `src/explore_dataset.py` for comprehensive data exploration, finding 7648 missing values and saving a label distribution chart.
- Created and executed `src/train_classifier.py` to train a baseline PyTorch MLP classifier. The model achieved a perfect 1.00 F1-score across all classes on the 20% test split (208,951 samples) after 10 epochs (final loss: 0.0006).
- Built the ONNX export pipeline in `src/export_onnx.py` to convert the trained PyTorch model to `.onnx` format.
- Validated that the PyTorch and ONNX models produce the same outputs on a subset of test samples.
- Updated Sections 3 and 4 of `docs/proposal.md` outlining the methodology and implementation.

### What I Learned
- How to efficiently load and explore large CSV datasets using pandas.
- The process of exporting a trained PyTorch model (MLP) into the ONNX framework for edge deployment.
- How to load and run inference on an exported ONNX model and compare outputs to ensure high fidelity during conversion.

### Problems / Blockers
- Handled dataset class imbalance effectively during baseline model training.
- Ensuring the exact same preprocessing (like scaling and encoding) was applied during PyTorch inference and ONNX validation.

### Next Week Plan
- Refine the baseline model and explore hyperparameter tuning.
- Evaluate the model's performance metrics (accuracy, F1 score, precision) on the full test set.
- Further investigate memory and latency benchmarks for the ONNX model.
- Continue reading and summarizing additional references for the literature review.

## Week 3 & 4

**Branch:** `sikandarhussain6858-week-04`
**PR link:** _[Add link after opening PR]_

### Checklist
- [x] Refactored architecture to extract shared `ThreatMLP` model (`src/model.py`)
- [x] Implemented INT8 Static Quantization pipeline using ONNX Runtime
- [x] Evaluated and benchmarked quantized model size, latency, and Macro-F1 delta
- [x] Developed semantic labeling mapping for MITRE ATT&CK (`src/mitre_mapping.py`)
- [x] Built and tested `FastAPI` Inference Engine (`src/inference_engine.py`)
- [x] Conducted Cross-Dataset Generalization testing on ToN-IoT dataset (RQ3)
- [x] Migrated heavy computation to Kaggle to bypass local memory constraints

### What I Did These Weeks
- **Kaggle Training Pipeline:** Migrated training to Kaggle to overcome local memory constraints and leverage free GPUs. Modified the code to load multiple days of the CIC-IDS2018 dataset (using Parquet format).
- **Data Leakage & Class Imbalance:** Addressed data leakage by stripping identifying features (IPs, Ports, Flow IDs). Implemented undersampling for majority classes (Benign) and oversampling for minority classes, plus a learning rate scheduler, stabilizing the Macro-F1 score at ~0.83 on the valid features.
- **Model Quantization (RQ2):** Exported the PyTorch model to FP32 ONNX format and applied INT8 Static Quantization using `onnxruntime.quantization`. 
- **Cross-Dataset Evaluation (RQ3):** Tested the CIC-IDS2018-trained model on the completely unseen ToN-IoT dataset without retraining to evaluate out-of-distribution generalization.
- **Inference Engine:** Built `src/inference_engine.py` using FastAPI. It acts as the core "engine" by accepting raw network features, applying the saved standard scaler, running ONNX inference, and mapping predictions to MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques.

### Key Findings & Results
- **Quantization Benchmarks (RQ2):** The INT8 quantized model reduced the storage footprint by roughly 70% (from ~75 KB down to ~22 KB). The latency and Macro-F1 impact were successfully benchmarked and stored in `experiments/results/quantization_comparison.json`.
- **Cross-Dataset Generalization (RQ3):** The evaluation on ToN-IoT yielded a massive Macro-F1 drop from 0.8296 (in-distribution) down to 0.0843. 
  - *Analysis of the Drop:* This drop definitively answers RQ3. It is primarily caused by feature space incompatibility. Only 21 out of 76 features (28%) could be semantically mapped between NetFlow (ToN-IoT) and CICFlowMeter (CIC-IDS2018). This negative result is highly valuable, confirming that IDS models are tightly coupled to their feature extraction tools and do not easily generalize out-of-the-box.

### Problems / Blockers Addressed
- **Memory & Resource Constraints:** Loading the entire CIC-IDS2018 dataset crashed the local environment. Resolved by moving computation to Kaggle, using Parquet files, and selectively sampling data.
- **Data Leakage & Overfitting:** The baseline model initially achieved a perfect 1.0 F1. Discovered this was due to the model memorizing identifiers like `Src IP` and `Src Port`. Dropping these columns resolved the leakage.
- **Feature Alignment for RQ3:** Aligning ToN-IoT and CIC-IDS2018 features programmatically failed because the underlying extraction tools name features differently. Resolved by manually creating a semantic `FEATURE_MAP` connecting 21 common features.

### Next Week Plan
- Review and finalize the technical implementation.
- Address any code review feedback from the supervisor on the Week 3/4 PR.
- Draft the final project report (`docs/final-report.md`) outlining the methodology, evaluation, and conclusions.
